# Ilmapaine_Projekti
Embedded Systems Project

This projects idea is to control fan by using various sensors and automation methods.

## Features:
- LCD screen displays the current mode and basic statistics. It is used to:
    - as a control interface
    - to change fan control mode
    - adjust fan speed
    - set pressure level target
    - show error notifications.
- User interface
    - Controlled by using external buttons and a LCD screen.
- Automatic mode
    - adjusts the fan speed by monitoring pressure level in the ventilation duct
    - PA level is adjustable and is used to set fan behavior (0 - 120 pa)
- Manual mode
    - Fan speed can be set by the interface (0 - 100%)
